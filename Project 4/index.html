          <h2>App Development</h2>
          <p>App development is the process of creating software applications that run on mobile devices like smartphones and
            tablets. It can be divided into two main types: Android development and iOS development. Android apps are usually
            built
            using Java or Kotlin.

            divided
            into two parts: Frontend and Backend. Frontend is what the user sees and interacts with, built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Teena Agrawal, a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in full-stack web development. I
      enjoy building clean, user-friendly interfaces and bringing ideas to life through code. Currently, I'm sharpening my
      skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB while also preparing for the SSC CGL exam. As an aspiring developer, I believe in
      consistent learning, discipline, and solving real-world problems with practical solutions. I'm always up for new
      challenges and opportunities that push me beyond my comfort zone. My background as an engineer gives me a logical edge
      in development and analysis. I’ve built a few personal projects and continue to improve them. In my free time, I enjoy
      writing, reflecting, and helping others learn. I’m working towards a career that balances creativity, purpose, and
      growth.
